# Deployment Guide

This guide provides multiple options for deploying your React + Supabase application to the internet.

## Prerequisites

1. **Database is already set up**: Your Supabase database is configured and accessible at `https://xqhyfvxirabxfivafmtt.supabase.co`
2. **Build successful**: The application builds without errors (`npm run build`)
3. **Dependencies installed**: All required packages are installed

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)

Vercel is perfect for React applications and has excellent GitHub integration.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" and import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect the build settings from `vercel.json`
5. Click "Deploy"

**Configuration**: Already included in `vercel.json`

### Option 2: Netlify

Another excellent choice for static sites with great CI/CD.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up
3. Click "New site from Git" and connect your repository
4. Netlify will automatically use the settings from `netlify.toml`
5. Click "Deploy site"

**Configuration**: Already included in `netlify.toml`

### Option 3: Railway (For Containerized Deployment)

Railway supports Docker containers and is great for full-stack applications.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up
3. Create a new project and connect your GitHub repository
4. Railway will automatically detect the `Dockerfile` and build the container
5. Your app will be deployed with a public URL

**Configuration**: `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` are included

### Option 4: Render

Similar to Railway, supports both static sites and Docker containers.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
3. Choose "Static Site" for a simple deployment or "Web Service" for Docker
4. Connect your repository and configure:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
5. Click "Create Static Site"

### Option 5: GitHub Pages

Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to your repository settings → Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./dist
```

## Database Status ✅

Your Supabase database is working correctly with the following tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles and roles
- `schools` - School information
- `classes` - Class management
- `students` - Student records
- `subjects` - Subject management
- `assessments` - Assessment data
- `grades` - Student grades
- `comments` - Class comments

All Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured.

## Build Optimization

The build is successful but produces a large bundle (508.92 kB). Consider these optimizations:

1. **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based code splitting
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Run `npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer` and analyze bundle size
3. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure unused dependencies are removed

## Quick Deploy Commands

Choose your preferred platform and run:

```bash
# For Vercel
npx vercel

# For Netlify
npx netlify-cli deploy --prod

# For Docker (local testing)
docker build -t my-school-app .
docker run -p 3000:80 my-school-app
```

## Environment Variables

If you need to customize Supabase settings in the future, you can add environment variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase URL (currently hardcoded)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key (currently hardcoded)

## Support

Your application is ready for deployment! The database is functional and the build process works correctly. Choose any of the deployment options above based on your preferences.
